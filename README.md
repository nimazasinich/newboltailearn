- ✅ Real-time dataset downloads with progress tracking
- ✅ Automatic dataset processing and storage
- ✅ WebSocket progress updates
- ✅ Error handling and retry mechanisms

**To use HuggingFace integration:**

3. Set `HF_TOKEN_ENC=your_base64_encoded_token` in `.env`
4. Restart the server

## 🔒 Security & Authentication

### JWT Authentication System ✅
- **JWT-based Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication for all sensitive routes
- **Role-based Access Control**: Admin, Trainer, Viewer, and User roles with hierarchical permissions
- **Protected Routes**: All sensitive operations require authentication:
  - Model training, pause, resume operations
  - Dataset downloads
  - Advanced analytics access
  - User management

### Security Features ✅
- **Token Security**: HuggingFace tokens are Base64 encoded
- **Password Hashing**: bcryptjs with salt rounds for secure password storage
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data stored in `.env` with JWT_SECRET
- **Input Validation**: All inputs validated and sanitized
- **CORS**: Properly configured for development and production
- **SQL Injection Protection**: Parameterized queries throughout the application

### Authentication Setup
```bash
# Set JWT secret for authentication
echo "JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here" >> .env

# Default admin user is created automatically on first run:
# Username: admin
# Password: admin123
# Role: admin
```

## 📊 Database Schema (Fully Implemented)

npm run build

# Start unified server (serves both frontend and API)
npm run start:unified
```

### Docker Deployment - ✅ Working
```bash
# Build Docker image
npm run docker:build

# Run with Docker Compose
npm run docker:compose

# Deploy to staging
npm run deploy:staging

# Deploy to production
npm run deploy:production
```

### Development Build - ✅ Working
```bash
# Start frontend dev server
npm run dev

# Start backend server
npm run server
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
HF_TOKEN_ENC=your_base64_encoded_token  # Optional - for HuggingFace integration
NODE_ENV=production                      # Optional
PORT=3001                               # Optional - defaults to 3001
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Backend won't start**: 
   - Run `npm run compile-server` first ✅
   - Check if port 3001 is available

2. **Token errors**: 
   - HuggingFace integration requires valid `HF_TOKEN_ENC` in `.env`
   - System works without it, but dataset downloads will fail

3. **Build errors**: 
   - Check TypeScript compilation: `npm run type-check`
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`

4. **WebSocket issues**: 
   - Verify both frontend and backend are running
   - Check browser console for connection errors

### Debug Mode
```bash
export DEBUG=persian-legal-ai:*
npm run server
```
