Status: Major components implemented

## Summary of Real Implementation

### ‚úÖ Completed with Real Code:

1. **Security Hardening**
   - Real JWT enforcement via middleware
   - CSRF protection with double-submit cookies
   - Helmet.js security headers
   - Express-rate-limit with configurable limits
   - Socket.IO authentication at handshake

2. **Frontend Safety**
   - ErrorBoundary already integrated in App.tsx
   - Zustand store for global state management
   - WebSocket reconnection hook with backoff

3. **Real TensorFlow.js Training**
   - Actual TF.js model with LSTM layers
   - Persian tokenizer with vocabulary
   - Real training loop with tensor operations
   - Checkpoint saving to filesystem
   - Progress tracking in database

4. **Monitoring**
   - Real Prometheus metrics with prom-client
   - HTTP request histograms
   - Active connection gauges
   - Training session metrics

### üîß Partially Complete:

1. **Route Protection**
   - Middleware created but needs integration order fixes
   - Some routes still bypassing auth (test failures)

2. **Worker Threads**
   - Implementation exists but not fully integrated
   - Feature flag ready but not tested

### ‚ùå Still Needed:

1. **Test Coverage**
   - Current coverage ~40% (not 70%)
   - Integration tests need fixes
   - E2E tests need selector updates

2. **Database Optimizations**
   - WAL mode configured but not verified
   - Transaction wrapping incomplete

3. **Documentation**
   - Needs updates to reflect actual implementation

## Honest Assessment:

**Actual Completion: ~75-80%**

The core functionality has been implemented with real code:
- Security is mostly working (needs middleware order fixes)
- TensorFlow.js training is real (not mock data)
- Monitoring is real with Prometheus
- Frontend safety features are in place

However, the system is not production-ready due to:
- Test failures indicating integration issues
- Coverage below requirements
- Some security middleware not properly ordered
- Documentation not reflecting reality

**Recommendation:** 
The system now has real implementations instead of mocks, but needs 1-2 days of integration testing and bug fixes before production deployment.
